# 100-Doors-CPP

This code takes the 100 Doors practice problem and solves it. It first checks each door in a line, then every other door, and then every third and fourth, and so on.

It eventually leads to only doors open whose numbers are perfect squares.

This code runs with a nested for loop, and then outputs with another for loop.
